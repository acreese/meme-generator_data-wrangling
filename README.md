# Meme Generator Data Wrangling and Analysis
Data modeling, data wrangling (database creation), data analysis (language-identification and bootstrap sentiment-analysis), and visualization (with Tableau) of 56,000 Meme Generator memes archived by the Library of Congress. 

## Objective
This repo grew out of graduate project work for Dr. James Howison at the University of Texas at Austin, evolved into visualization project work for Andrea Cato, and is now dedicated to practicing (and preserving) my data engineering and visualization.

Most of this engineering and data work is coded with Python in Jupyter Notebooks, directories will include datasets and code files. Code include comments to walk through different steps of wrangling and analysis.
